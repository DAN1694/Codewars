/*
* Problem Statement: 
*
* Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters
* as input and returns the missing letter in the array.
*
* You will always get an valid array, and there will always be exactly
* one letter missing. The length of the array will always be at least 2.
* The array will always contain letters in only one case.
*
* Example:
*
* ['a','b','c','d','f'] -> 'e'
* ['O','Q','R','S'] -> 'P'
*
* (Use the English alphabet with 26 letters!)
*
* Language Used: Java.
