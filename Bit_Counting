/*
* Problem Statement: Write a function that takes an integer as input and
* returns the number of bits equal to one in the binary representation
* of that integer. You can guarantee the input is non-negative.
*
* Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so in this case,
* the function should return 5.
* 
* Language Used: Java.
